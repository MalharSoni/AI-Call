- **Main Server**: http://localhost:3000
- **Webhook Endpoint**: http://localhost:3000/voice/incoming

### 4. Configure Twilio Webhooks (For Live Calls)
1. In your Twilio console, go to Phone Numbers → Manage → Active Numbers
2. Click on your number: +16475592113
3. Set Voice Webhook URL to: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/voice/incoming`
4. Use ngrok for local development: `ngrok http 3000`

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Setup Flow**: Enter business URL → System crawls website → Generates Agent Card & FAQs
2. **Call Flow**: Caller dials Twilio number → AI answers using website knowledge → Offers SMS booking link or warm transfer to staff
